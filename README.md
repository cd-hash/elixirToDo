# Elixir CLI To Do List application

This is my very simple implementation of a To Do list CLI app written completely in Elixir.

## Running the app
To run it all you need is a working installation of Elixir. I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/-I8V-FcuX2E) for downloading Elixir to my chromebook with dev mode enabled. Once you have verified your installation is working you can clone or fork this repository and simply run elixir minimal_todo.ex in the command line or you can run it in iex.
