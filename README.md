# Elixir CLI To Do List application

This is my very simple implementation of a To Do list CLI app written completely in base Elixir.
I'm following the intro projects that are laid out by [alchemist.camp](https://alchemist.camp/start). Since this is my 3rd language I am coding the solutions my way and then watching the videos to get a sense of what good elixir code looks like.

## Running the app

To run it all you need is a working installation of Elixir. I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/-I8V-FcuX2E) for downloading Elixir to my chromebook with dev mode enabled. Once you have verified your installation is working you can clone or fork this repository and simply run `elixir minimal_todo.ex` in the command line or you can run it in iex.
